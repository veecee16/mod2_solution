Coursera, John Hopkins University, Lecturer Yaakov Chaikin, Week 2 Module Assignment

This assignment involved building a webpage, consisting of a main title located above 3 separate boxes. Each of these boxes contains it's own title floated right, again within its own little box. 

In this assignment, an introduction to responsive web design, via media queries is explored.

Thank you in advance for any assistance, suggestions, constructive feedback that is offered on my assignment.
